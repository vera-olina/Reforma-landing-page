## Introduction

'Reforma' is a premier independent coffee shop, co-founded during the war in Ukraine in 2023 by my sister Polina Olina.

I designed a unique responsive interactive UI using Figma for a web application with a hidden Hoffmann Coffee Calculator. This calculator helps you determine brew ratios for delicious coffee based on [James Hoffmann's](https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk) recipes. You can access it by clicking on the mug image on the Home page of the website. Additionally, you can view the founders' photos by hovering over their names and scroll through interior photos using a button on the right side of the page.

The navigation bar includes Home, Menu, and a Contact form. The contact form was created using EmailJS, a backend-as-a-service for receiving client requests from the website and providing rapid responses. The Menu page renders menu items from a dynamic menu data object, which is customizable and offers unlimited options for its purpose.

The project stands out with unique illustrations generated with AI by [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home).

## Technologies
This project was scaffoldede with [Vite plugin](https://vitejs.dev) for React and utilizes the backend-as-a-service [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
It is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## Known issues (Work in Progress)

* The Hoffman Coffee Calculator is currently hidden for the mobile version.
* The mobile toggle menu doesn't expire automatically after switching pages, which is not ideal for user experience.

I'm actively working on resolving these issues, so please stay tuned for updates!
